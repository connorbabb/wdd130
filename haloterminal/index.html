                    <h1>Forge Creations</h2>
                    <p>This Page is all about the community and what they create using the Forge tools. 
                        Forge is a massive level creator given to players to create a variety of levels, games, modes, and more using the in-game sandbox.
                        Forge has recently been given massive upgrades that allows fans to create so much more with the tools available.
                        The best creations are featured here, updated every day. The official game site doesn't have a dedicated section for displaying and showcasing many creations from the
                        community, so this site is mainly dedicated to that feature.
