                <h3>Launch of Season 5: Reckoning</h3>
                <p>The Launch of Halo Infinite's 5th season has just taken place on October 17th. It's the most content rich update the game has ever seen, and without a doubt the most exciting one we've ever had. The free Season 5: Reckoning update brings with it 
                    a vast amount of new content. Two new maps, prism, and forbidden, Halo 4's Extraction mode reimagined, multi-core helmets, a new 50-tier Premium Battle 
                    Pass (that never expires) alongside two Operations, Flood-themed customization, the Bandit Evo, and more... 
                    Also featured in this update is the next game-changing evolution of Forge. Players are now able to create their
                    very own PvE experiences. This all has launched free and all of this takes place right now, so let's get into it!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="season5-msg02-text">
                <p>First off, the battle pass for this season has been shortened to about half the size, but they have gotten rid of 
                    a lot of useless tiers that would give you a duplicate shoulder or emblem. These have been combined which will make the battle
                    pass a much better experience to progress. Extraction comes to Halo Infinite in Season 5! Extraction is an objective-based game mode that was first introduced in Halo 4, 
                    and now this beloved mode has a new coat of paint with the latest UNSC and Personal AI tech in Halo Infinite.
                    Deploy Extraction Sites at different locations on the map to score points. Protect the site as it counts down to capture, as 
                    the enemy team can convert and extract it for themselves. Multi-core helmets have also arrived in Season 5! They have made 
                    adjustments to every helmet in Halo Infinite, which means that all helmets in the game are available on all Armor Cores.
                    There are going to be so many more combinations you can come up with as customization flexibility becomes more expansive than ever. 
                    The M392 Bandit has a new variant—the “Bandit Evo.” When the M392 Bandit was originally added in Season 3, it replaced 
                    the scope of the familiar DMR with iron sights to make it more of a close-to-medium range weapon. The Bandit Evo features 
                    a new scope along with improved recoil and bloom control, making it the perfect tool for those mid-ranged encounters—but 
                    if you get hit while aiming, you will get descoped. Skill with this weapon is expressed through precision. Five headshots 
                    or seven body shots will net you a kill, so make those shots count! This weapon will be replacing the Battle Rifle in ranked or competitive playlists.
                    We also have some things coming later in Season 5. One of those is Firefight King of the Hill—a 
                    new take on the classic mode where four players must capture and defend hills against an onslaught of Banished forces.
                    You may find yourself thrown into battle within the bloodied walls of the House of Reckoning, or you might just find that 
                    Firefight King of the Hill will take you to some other battlefields as well... 
                    Another thing coming later this season is the repair field equipment. Enhance your tactical support gameplay with a new piece of Equipment coming to Halo Infinite later in Season 5.
                    Deploy this device that attaches to surfaces and vehicles, which—after a short arming time—emits a healing field that 
                    restores Spartan health and repairs vehicles before it eventually self-destructs. Be wary: the Repair Field’s effect is 
                    neutral, so it’ll do the same for your enemies as it will for you.

                <h3>AI in Forge</h3>
                <p>Along with season 5 also launched the ability to script and play against AI. The Forge AI Toolkit features 43 total units from Halo Infinite's campaign, 
                    including UNSC, Banished, and Forerunner characters. This will lead to so many different scenarios that can be created in forge
                    Players can adjust numerous options around these AI units through Forge settings and node graphs, from how they arrive into 
                    the map (whether they are deployed by a Phantom, drop pod, or spawn in) to whether they’re friend or foe, what they react 
                    (or don’t react) to, their difficulty level, and so much more. Maybe you want to spice up your PvP matches with some AI 
                    units—you can make it so capturing a neutral zone spawns two Hunters who will fight by your side.
