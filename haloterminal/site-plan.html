        <b>Why is Forge so Important?</b>
        This Page is all about the community and what they create using the Forge tools. 
        Forge is a massive level creator given to players to create a variety of levels, games, modes, and more using the in-game sandbox.
        Forge has recently been given massive upgrades that allows fans to create so much more with the tools available.
        The best creations are featured here, updated every day. The official game site doesn't have a dedicated section for displaying and showcasing many creations from the
        community, so this site is mainly dedicated to that feature. 
        <b>What can I find in the Forge Creations Section?</b>
        You will be able to search for specific games and modes that you're looking to play. Want to play campaign style maps using the new AI toolkit? 
        Maybe you want to see classic maps remade in Halo Infinite? Or maybe you want to have fun in wacky "action-sack" style modes and maps.
        The section will showcase categories of forge creations to select and look into further, showing pictures for each category.
